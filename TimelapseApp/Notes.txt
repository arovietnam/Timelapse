Introduction
------------
Timelapser is a console application that will run on every capturing server by 24/7 to create (paused & recording) 
timelapses which are already requested/queued by users of http://timelapse.camba.tv. ApplicationMonitor.exe on 
that server will ensure that singleton instance of Timelapser is always running there. Application will create 
new instance of TimelapseCreator.exe for every new request in Timelapses table in SQL DB (similar to Cam. Recorder).
After successfully creating a Timelapse its TimelapseCreator.exe will update related Timelapse's status in SQL DB.

In Future
---------
- we may use Timelapser to create custom timelapses based on Admin requests (may be via a simple window GUI app.)

TimelapseCreator.exe will
-------------------------
- be a console application running for single Timelapse generation
- have its console window title as Timelapse ID: Timelapse Title
- generate timelapse video in multiple formats (e.g. mp4, webm, ogv, etc.)
- kill itself after creating paused timelapse and will keep on updating a recording timelapse
- log success/failure details in its own logs.txt file

RestSharp
---------
var client = new RestClient("http://webapi.camba.tv/");

var request = new RestRequest("v1/auth/token", Method.POST);
request.AddParameter("user_name", "azhar.malik@mhlabs.net");
request.AddParameter("user_password", "4240");
//request.AddHeader("header", "value");

var response = client.Execute(request);
// or
client.DownloadData(request).SaveAs(path);
